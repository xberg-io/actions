# Decide which paths the Rust build cache covers, and explain the one exclusion.
#
# `target/` is excluded on macOS. Measured on xberg CI run 33656679479: every
# build, test, doctest and clippy step on macos-latest SUCCEEDED, finishing
# 130 minutes in. The job then spent 24 minutes in the actions/cache POST step
# without finishing and was killed by the 150-minute timeout, so a green run
# was reported as `cancelled`. The same POST step completes in 3.6 minutes on
# ubuntu-latest, 4.2 on ubuntu-24.04-arm and under 2 on windows-latest.
#
# A `--all-features` workspace target/ directory is tens of GB, and macOS
# runners cannot compress and upload one inside a job's lifetime. Raising the
# timeout does not fix this: the build already fits, and the save does not
# converge -- it was still running 24 minutes in with no sign of completing.
#
# Excluding it is affordable because sccache is configured with
# SCCACHE_GHA_ENABLED (see configure-flags.sh), so compiled artifacts are
# already cached through the Actions cache backend independently of this step.
# What is lost is the part sccache does not cover -- build-script output and
# proc-macro expansion -- not the compilation itself.
