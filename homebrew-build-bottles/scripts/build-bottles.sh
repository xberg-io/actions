  # therefore raises `UntrustedTapError`, which `brew tap` reports as the badly misleading
  # `Cannot tap <tap>: invalid syntax in tap!`. Observed on alef v0.88.0's arm64_sequoia
  # leg (job 104114753052): the runner started on 6.0.22, `brew update` pulled it to 7.x
  # mid-job, and the tap then failed five times under `retry` with
  # `Refusing to load formula xberg-io/tap/alef from untrusted tap xberg-io/tap`.
  #

  # the name via `Tap.fetch` and does not need the tap on disk, whereas trusting afterwards
  # is dead code the tap never reaches.
