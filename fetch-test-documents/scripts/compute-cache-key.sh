# corpus.lock.json changes, the previous run's object store is still restored and fetch.sh only
# downloads the objects that actually changed, instead of re-pulling the whole selection. Objects
# are content-addressed and immutable, and every one is re-verified against its sha256 before use,
# so reusing a stale store is always safe. Reversing this order silently reverts to a full
# re-download on every manifest bump.
